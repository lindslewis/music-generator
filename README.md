## Project Description

This project was a collaborative group effort based on the USER STORY outlined here:
AS A music lover
I WANT to be exposed to new music
SO THAT I can expand my musical horizons

This application includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, CSS framework, media players (linked to music in MP3 format and the incorporation of two separate sever-side APIs) that the user is able to interact with. 

One API allows the user to search for upcoming concerts based on artist name. The other API allows the user to search for discographies based on artist name.

## How to Use

When the User opens the browser to the deployed site, they are presented with four separate media players -- each of these media player holds a playlist of songs compiled by the corresponding developer. In order to go to player, the user must hit the desired playlist tab: 
- "love with asiya"
- "elevate with jovi"
- "chill with stevie"
- "vibe with lindsay"

The media players have previous/next/pause/play buttons, as well as a clickable progress bar, to navigate through the songs and/or playlists.

When the song is playing, a pop up container with the name of the song/progress bar will show. As the song plays, the progress bar will increase. 

At the bottom of the page, a button with the text "return home" will allow the user to return to the homepage, when clicked. 

At the top of the homepage, in a nav-bar are the words "venture further", when clicked, this takes the user to the bottom of the homepage. At the bottom of the homepage are clickable/searchable text boxes. One prompts the user to "Enter Artist Name Here for Concert Info", or "Enter Artist Name Here for Album Info". When the user types in their request, the user will then be taken to a new tab, containing their requested information.



## Known Bugs/Possible Future Edits

Known Bugs:
- the absence of edge case code for invalid input(s)/null responses

Plans for Future Editing:
- rendering recent searches from page into local storage
- ability to like songs from the playlist, to be stored and rendered to the page
- adding the artist name(s) to the corresponding songs within the media players
- increasing the amount of songs per playlist
- randomization of the playlist
