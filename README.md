## Project Description

This project was a collabortive group effort based on the USER STORY outlined below:
AS A music lover
I WANT to be exposed to new music
SO THAT I can expand my musical horizons

This application includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, CSS framework, media players linked to music in MP3 format and the incorporation of two separate sever-side APIs that the user is able to interact with. One API allows the user to search for upcoming concerts based on artist name. Once a concert searches has been completed by the User it will be stored locally and rendered to the page. The other API allows the user to search for discographies based on artist name.

## How to Use

When the User opens the browser to the deployed site, they are presented with four separate media players. Each media player holds a playlist of songs compiled by the corresponding developer. The media players have buttons to help navigate through playlists. When a song is played, the name of the song is displayed at the top of the media player. At the bottom of the browser page there are two text input windows. One text input box includes a placeholder prompt to "Enter Artist Here" with an associated button titled "Hit up some concerts!" The second text input box includes a place holder prompt to "Enter Artist Here" with an associated button titled "Search Engine Catalogue!!" When the User types in their search parameters and clicks the corresponding button then they will be directed to a new tab containing the information they requested.
